# TheCrazyPasswordGen

## Description

In short, this is simply a page that generates a random password based on criteria options available to the user. Our main criteria options availible include the following: 
- Capitols
- Lower Case
- Numbers
- Symbols
- Option for a lenght between 8 and 128 characters.

This project was my first working in depth with JavaScript. All of the HTML and CSS was provided prior missing the JavaScript and it was fun to research the various ways to try and get what I wanted to happen done and playing with various attempts to find what clicked and worked for me.

Having gone through and now having the code working and generating password based on the criteria and options with a user interface, I have a better understanding of how functions work and interact with eachother and how many different ways they can be used.

Parts of this were particularly challenging for me, specifically getting the commands to prompt for input from the user and then take that input and apply it to create the output based on the input. There were quiet a few different ways that I could find to do this in my research and after a bit of trial and error finally it clicked the best way to use what I was researching to get my outcome!

I learned a lot about the differences between let and var, at first glance upon seeing them in research materials and thinking that they were basically interchangeable. I also learned a lot about de-bugging this go around as there were many times where I thought I had it done and ready to go only to see errors popping up in the chrome dev tools. It is really helpful that they indicate where the initial issue is so I could use the dev tools to pinpoint what was not working and try to figure out ways to get it working.

## Usage

To use this app please first visit the page here: https://sikoticvinyl.github.io/TheCrazyPasswordGen/

Once you are on the main page you will see a big red button that says "Generate Password" and when you click on this button a prompt box should come up and begin to ask for input. Enter input requested and once finished the page will put the generated password into the middle of the box to be copied for ease of use.
